A credit card cash advance is a loan from your credit card issuer. As with your everyday purchases, the cash advance will appear as a transaction on your monthly card statement.

However, the terms for cash advances are different from those of purchasesâ€”and not in your favor. There usually is no grace period for cash advances; interest starts accumulating from the date of the transaction. Additionally, the interest rate is usually higher for cash advances than for purchases.1
Credit Card Cash Advance Terms

Details about cash advance fees and terms can be found in the Schumer box on your card statement as well as in the original credit card agreement. Below is an example from the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It shows that the annual percentage rate (APR) for a cash advance is 29.99%, compared to a minimum of 21.49% for purchases. The fee is either $10 or 5% of the advance, whichever is greater.
