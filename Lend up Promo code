Lend up Promo code

Lend up Promo code plans allow participants to borrow funds from their personal accounts. Interest rates and fees vary from plan to plan but generally are competitive with the rates on loans from a bank. The maximum loan limit is 50% of your vested account balance, up to $50,000, and repayment generally must be completed in five years or less.2 There's typically no credit check, and payments can be set up as automatic deductions from your paychecks.3 Keep in mind that while you're borrowing funds from your Lend up Promo code, they're not earning any investment returns, which could affect how much money you'll have available to you at retirement.
